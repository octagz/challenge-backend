# Assumptions

- The distance to USA is calculated to the capital, which is Washington D.C. (38.896360099565925, -77.04795855389095)
- There's only one official currency per country
- There's restrictions on the free API plan of fixer.io that forces to use EUR as the base coin. That implies extra work from the backend.
